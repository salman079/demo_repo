## Tables
You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens `-` (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe `|`:

First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column

## Blockquotes 
As Kanye West said:
> We're living the future so <br>
> the present is our past.

## Inline code
I think you should use an`<addr>` element here instead.

## Code
There are many different ways to style code with GitHub's markdown. If you have inline code blocks, wrap them in backticks: `var example = true`.  If you've got a longer block of code, you can indent with four spaces:

    if (isAwesome){
      return true
    }

GitHub also supports something called code fencing, which allows for multiple lines without indentation:

```
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

And if you'd like to use syntax highlighting, include the language:

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```
## Username @mentions
Typing an @ symbol, followed by a username, will notify that person to come and view the comment.

## SHA references
Any reference to a commit’s SHA-1 hash will be automatically converted into a link to that commit on GitHub.

## Issue references within a repository
Any number that refers to an Issue or Pull Request will be automatically converted into a link.

#1
mojombo#1
mojombo/github-flavored-markdown#1
Username @mentions
Typing an @ symbol, followed by a username, will notify that person to come and view the comment. This is called an “@mention”, because you’re mentioning the individual. You can also @mention teams within an organization.

## Automatic linking for URLs
Any URL (like http://www.github.com/) will be automatically converted into a clickable link.

## Strikethrough
Any word wrapped with two tildes (like ~~this~~) will appear crossed out.

## Emoji
GitHub supports emoji!
